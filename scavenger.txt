Problem 1: Terminal Scavenger Hunt

1.	What is your unix username?
% whomami
jasonmarshall
 

2.	What is the full path to your home directory?
% echo $HOMe
/Users/jasonmarshall

 

3.	What is the full path to your Downloads directory?
% echo %HOME/Downloads
/Users/jasonmarshall/Downloads


4.	Download the DATA120 syllabus and check how many files are in the Downloads directory.
% ls -l %HOME/Downloads | ls -l | grep ^- | wc -l
1026
 

5.	How much hard drive space is used by all the files in Downloads?  I should probably 
delete some things.
% du -sh $HOME/Downloads
28G

6.	Save the DATA120 syllabus in a different location. What does the prompt look like? Will 
it change when you change directories?

% mv $HOME/Downloads/DATA-120-W24-syllabus.pdf $HOME/Desktop/

The prompt should remain the same because both the original and the new location paths are specified relative to HOME not whatever directory you're in. 
 

The prompt should remain the same because both the original and new location paths are specified 
relative to HOME and not whatever directory I’m in. 

7.	What do you see if you run echo $PATH?
% echo $PATH
A list of directories where the system looks for executable files

8.	Does $PATH contain any directories in your user directory?
It contains the Users/jasonmarshall path which was my user directory.

9.	Find the most recently modified or created file in your downloads.
% ls -lth $HOME/Downloads | grep -v '^d' | head -n 2


10.	 The command in which python returns the path of the system’s default python. Where is that?
% which python
 

11.	 “ls -FG /” produces a directory listing of the root of the file system. Does anything look familiar? 

I see the “Users/” directory and many other directories which also appeared as a result of the “echo $PATH” command.  


12.	Use SSH to login to the CS linux cluster
% ssh jmarshall17@uchicago@linux.cs.uchicago.edu


13.	Find md5 hash of a local file
% md5 Data-120-W24-Syllabus.pdf


14.	Use SCP to copy the file to the CS server. Confirm that the local file on the CS server has the same hash.

Copy
% scp /Users/jasonmarshall/desktop/data120/Data-120-W24-Syllabus.pdf jmarshall17@linux.cs.uchicago.edu:~

Confirm Hash
jmarshall17@linux1:~$ md5sum Data-120-W24-Syllabus.pdf


15.	Use ls -l to confirm that you have created a file on your account on the server.

jmarshall17@linux1:~$ ls -l
The syllabus is on my account on the server.
